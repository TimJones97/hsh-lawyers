                In excess of 10,000 Queenslanders are convicted of drink or drug driving each year. It is a serious offence and can have serious ramifications on your life. Licence disqualification naturally follows conviction for these offences. Penalties range from fines to actual imprisonment.

                  It is possible, under certain circumstances to obtain what is commonly known as a Work License. Conditions as to the eligibility to apply are set out by legislation.

                <p>
                  If you wish to apply for a "work license" an application must be made to the court before you plead guilty and the application must be accompanied by a number of documents.

              <p>
                Preparing a will means that you stay in control. If you die without a legal will, the Succession Act legislates how your assets will be distributed, with all costs coming out of your estate. This means that if you die your spouse will have to share your estate with your children (if you have any). 
              </p>
              <p>
                To avoid losing control of how your estate is distributed, you should ensure that your will is always current. This is particularly important when selling or purchasing property and particularly when getting married and divorced or with the arrival of children and in a blended family situation.

              <hr>
              <p>
                An Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) does not mean that you lose control! Instead, an EPA gives someone that you trust, perhaps your partner or child, the authority to make decisions for you when you are unable to make them for yourself. If you do not have an EPA, your family or friends may have to endure a process of investigation and possibly a hearing through the legal system to decide whether it is necessary to appoint you a Guardian (for health & lifestyle decisions) or an Administrator (for financial decisions). This process is lengthy, complicated and expensive, and you have no say in who gets appointed to be your Guardian or Administrator.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another benefit of having an EPA is that you decide whether your EPA comes into effect immediately, or at some future point in time. We can explain this to you.
