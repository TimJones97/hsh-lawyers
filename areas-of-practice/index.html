                      Title searches - this establishes who the owners of the property are in terms of who is listed on the deed. The Title Deed also includes the official description of the property, which is important for the transfer of documents and establishing exactly what property is being bought or sold.

              <p>
                Preparing a will means that you stay in control. If you die without a legal will, the Succession Act legislates how your assets will be distributed, with all costs coming out of your estate. This means that if you die your spouse will have to share your estate with your children (if you have any). 
              </p>
              <p>
                To avoid losing control of how your estate is distributed, you should ensure that your will is always current. This is particularly important when selling or purchasing property and particularly when getting married and divorced or with the arrival of children and in a blended family situation.

                    Buying a Business
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Small to medium business acquisitions are often undertaken for a variety of reasons. Whether you are expanding an existing business or making a change for lifestyle reasons, we can assist to ensure the transaction is smooth and rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike real property, the value of a business is largely intangible in the form of goodwill. A business is made up of a myriad of rights and assets which all operate together to produce profit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In business acquisition, our role is to consolidate all of those parts to ensure that they will continue to operate effectively under new ownership.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When purchasing a business, there are a number of factors to consider:
                </p>
                <div class="split">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      the terms of the contract of sale provided by the seller or agent, or whether you wish us to draft the contract to present to the seller;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the most appropriate entity to purchase the business with, along with asset protection and taxation implications;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      whether you will need to have the business premises lease assigned to you;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      whether there is any vendor finance to be provided, loan agreements and securities which may be required;
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      whether the seller or other key persons should be restrained from competing against you after settlement;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      whether the assets of the business are encumbered and how to ensure you obtain clear title;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the transfer of intellectual property including trademarks and business names; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      whether the business is subject to franchise agreement.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <p>
                  When selling a business, and realising its value, you should consider:
                </p>
                <div class="split">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      special terms you might want included in the contract of sale;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      any representation or warranties you have made or which may be implied in the sale agreement, and possible director liability;
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      whether vendor finance is to be provided and what security you will take;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      any restraints of trade that have been proposed by the buyer.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                </p>
                <p>
                  We are experienced in the drafting, negotiation and completion of share sale and unit sale agreements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Share and unit sales are often conducted for tax planning reasons and can be more complex than business sales. They often involve the seller providing warranties for any 'skeletons in the closet' that may become the responsibility of the purchaser, such as unpaid tax. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Often a portion of the purchase price is held as a retention against any future claims against the seller of the company or unit trust.

              <hr>
              <p>
                An Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) does not mean that you lose control! Instead, an EPA gives someone that you trust, perhaps your partner or child, the authority to make decisions for you when you are unable to make them for yourself. If you do not have an EPA, your family or friends may have to endure a process of investigation and possibly a hearing through the legal system to decide whether it is necessary to appoint you a Guardian (for health & lifestyle decisions) or an Administrator (for financial decisions). This process is lengthy, complicated and expensive, and you have no say in who gets appointed to be your Guardian or Administrator.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another benefit of having an EPA is that you decide whether your EPA comes into effect immediately, or at some future point in time. We can explain this to you.

                <p>
                  An Advanced Health Directive puts you in complete control of your life when you are hospitalised in a terminal state. It directs what treatment you do and do not want to receive. The document is signed by your local GP who will have discussed the matter with you to ensure that you fully understand the conditions. It has an in built Power of Attorney in it so that someone can make the decision on your behalf should any further treatment not be an option.
